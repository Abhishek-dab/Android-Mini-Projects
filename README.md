# Android-Mini-Projects
- Async Task: 
In this project, I learned about [Async Task](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask) by making a book search app.
Just search for a book name in the search bar and you will get all the information about the book with its purchase URL.

- RecyclerView:
In this project, I learned about [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview) which shows all the information related to the different android versions in a dynamic list.
